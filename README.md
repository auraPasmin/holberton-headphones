## AirBnB_clone 💻

_The goal of the project is to implement a simple copy of the AirBnB website on your server.

Not all functions will be implemented, just some to cover all the fundamental concepts of 
the top level programming track.._

## 🎈 Synopsis 🎈

_These instructions allow you to obtain a copy of the "AirBnB_clone" project to work on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes.
this is a small step to a big project.._

## What the AirBnB does 🦐

_The AirBnB execute the diferents commands in the PATH_
_You must use the cmd module_

_🔴Your class definition should be: class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):_

_🔴the shell must implement:_

_🔴quity EOF to exit the program_

_🔴help (this action is provided by default, cmd but you should keep it updated and documented)
a personalized notice: (hbnb)_

_🔴an empty line + ENTER should not execute anything_

### Pre-requisites 📋

_To install to use this repository you must first have an environment to use it._

```
EXAMPLE: linux terminal
```


### Installation 🔧

_Here I will explain the steps to clone the repository to be able to use and modify the AirBnB_clone_

_clone the repository_

```
$ git clone [repositorio]
```

_To use the repository you must first enter it with the command_

```
$ cd
```

## Class 🔩
```
class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):

class BaseModel():

class Amenity(BaseModel):

class City(BaseModel):

class Place(BaseModel):

class Review(BaseModel):

class State(BaseModel):

class User(BaseModel):

class FileStorage:
```
## They run the tests⚙️

_how to run automated tests for this system_

```
$python3 -m unittest discover tests

$./console.py
```
### coding style tests ⌨️
```
## Console :space_invader:

### Usage:
_The "Console`" works in interactives sesson but also non-interactive mode. To run it in *Non-interactive*_

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
```
Also, it is possible to create a text file with test cases and pipe the content.
```

## Files

**base_model**

_as its name implies is the basis of our project.
This method will be the first part of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with "simple object type"_

**console.py**      

_This program called console.py which contains the entry shell of the AirBnB _

**_man_1_simple_shell_**

_This file has the description of the the shell and how it works._

**_README.md_**

_This file has the description of the funcions for the git._

**_Functions.c_** 

_This  file has the functions that we implement, _strcmp, execute, _path,

       _strdup, _strlen_

       **_Functions2.c_**

       _this file has the description of the funcions  _str‐, cat, _strncmp._
